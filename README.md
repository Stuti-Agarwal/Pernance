# Pernance
An OpenAI enabled Personal Chatbot


This Chatbot uses LangChain's conversation module with a pretrained model
Do try it out.
This initial commit is as per Kniru's take home assessment. Will be making it opensource and fully-free soon 


# NEXT STEPS
-Shifting to fully open source LLMS
- Integrating Tools Like Wolfram Alpha for better math 
- Fintuneing the model using indexing
- Webscraping off relevant website for latest affairs and using articles as context to further let the user question on current affairs data
